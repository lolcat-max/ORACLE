This program is a signal-to-math oracle, turning real analog phenomena into rule-based deterministic outcomes. It provides a non-interactive, non-random verification oracle rather than chance-driven randomness.

1. General Overview

The code implements an Advanced Analysis Oscilloscope for the Arduino UNO microcontroller. Its primary purpose is to monitor, analyze, and characterize ground state signals using concepts from functional analysis, specifically of a inductive circuit with a glass flyback diode.

The diode provides a permitted quantum transition path that allows the coil’s stored field energy to dissipate without forcing electrons into destructive high-energy tunneling events elsewhere.
