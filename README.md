This program is a signal-to-math oracle, turning real analog phenomena into rule-based deterministic outcomes. It provides a non-interactive, non-random verification oracle rather than chance-driven randomness.

1. General Overview

The code implements an Advanced Analysis Oscilloscope for the Arduino UNO microcontroller. Its primary purpose is to monitor, analyze, and characterize ground state signals using concepts from functional analysis, specifically frechet space convergence.

Unlike typical oscilloscopes, this system emphasizes mathematical structure recognition: it displays correlations, convergence of Cauchy sequences, and metric-space properties of sampled signals.
